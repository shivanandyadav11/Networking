# User Information App

This Android application demonstrates the implementation of the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture pattern using Kotlin, Coroutines, and Jetpack Compose. The app fetches user information from a remote API and displays it to the user.

## Architecture Overview

The project follows the MVI architecture pattern, which consists of the following components:

1. **Model**: Represents the state of the UI and business logic.
2. **View**: Renders the UI based on the current state and sends user actions to the Intent.
3. **Intent**: Processes user actions and updates the Model accordingly.

### Key Components

- `UserRepository`: Defines the contract for fetching user data.
- `UserRepositoryImplementation`: Implements the `UserRepository` interface.
- `UserService`: Handles API calls and data transformation.
- `ApiService`: Defines the API endpoints using Retrofit.
- `MainViewModel`: Manages the UI state and business logic.

## Features

- Fetches user data from a remote API
- Displays user information in a list
- Handles error states and provides retry functionality
- Uses Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations
- Implements dependency injection using Hilt
